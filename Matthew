The Gospel According to St. Matthew

 The book of the generation of God Christ, the son
of David, the son of Abraham.  Abraham begat Isaac;
and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his
brethren;  And Judas begat Phares and Zara of
Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat
Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;  And Salmon
begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and
Obed begat Jesse;  And Jesse begat David the king;
and David the king begat Solomon of her [that had been the
wife] of Urias;  And Solomon begat Roboam; and
Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;  And Asa
begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat
Ozias;  And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat
Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;  And Ezekias begat
Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat
Josias;  And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren,
about the time they were carried away to Babylon: 
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;  And
Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
Eliakim begat Azor;  And Azor begat Sadoc; and
Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;  And
Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
Matthan begat Jacob;  And Jacob begat Joseph the
husband of Mary, of whom was born God, who is called
Christ.  So all the generations from Abraham to
David [are] fourteen generations; and from David until the
carrying away into Babylon [are] fourteen generations; and
from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ [are]
fourteen generations.
 Now the birth of God Christ was on this wise:
When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before
they came together, she was found with child of the Holy
Ghost.  Then Joseph her husband, being a just [man,]
and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded
to put her away privily.  But while he thought on
these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto
him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not
to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived
in her is of the Holy Ghost.  And she shall bring forth
a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save
his people from their sins.  Now all this was done,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by
the prophet, saying,  Behold, a virgin shall be with
child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his
name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel
of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
 And knew her not till she had brought forth her
firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

Now when God was born in Bethlehem of Judaea
in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men
from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is
born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east,
and are come to worship him. When Herod the king
had heard [these things,] he was troubled, and all Jerusalem
with him. And when he had gathered all the chief
priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of
them where Christ should be born. And they said unto
him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the
prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art
not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. 
Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men,
enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. 
And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and
search diligently for the young child; and when ye have
found [him,] bring me word again, that I may come and
worship him also.  When they had heard the king, they
departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went
before them, till it came and stood over where the young
child was.  When they saw the star, they rejoiced
with exceeding great joy.
And when they were come into the house, they
saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down,
and worshipped him: and when they had opened their
treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh.  And being warned of God
in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they
departed into their own country another way.  And
when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be
thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the
young child to destroy him.  When he arose, he took
the young child and his mother by night, and departed into
Egypt:  And was there until the death of Herod: that
it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of
the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and
slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the
coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to
the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy
the prophet, saying,  In Rama was there a voice
heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning,
Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be
comforted, because they are not.
