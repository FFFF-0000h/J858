# J858
A faithful work inspired by John 8:58 - "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I AM" suggesting that he is (was) present even before Abraham walked the earth and when he (Abraham) did and after he (Abraham) did, a claim to mean that he (Jesus) is God. 

Shortly after he (Jesus) said this, the Jews sought to stone him.

Jesus claimed (claims, will claim) to be God.
